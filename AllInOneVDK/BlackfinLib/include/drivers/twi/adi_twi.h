Project:    TWI device driver
Title:      TWI definitions
 

Description:
   This is the primary include file for the TWI driver..

Note:
    The Open call will select a default bit rate of 100 kHz with a 50% duty
    cycle SCL. Master and Slave modes are exclusive. Master mode transfers are
    initiated with a Sequential I/O call. Slave buffers are submitted through
    Read and Write calls; transfers are driven by the bus master.

/* Within the ADI_DEV_SEQ_1D_BUFFER (Master mode transfers), the Buffer
struct contains the field pAdditionalInfo. This pointer field will be
treated as a u32 by the driver. The value is taken to be the address of the
I2C slave unless the value is the following define. Within the chain of
buffers, each buffer marked with this define will be sent to the slave
address of the preceeding buffer using I2C Repeated Start framing.

Note: the TWI can't perform a Repeated Start if the preceeding transfer is
longer than 254 bytes. The driver will instead service the Buffer using the
previous address in a new frame, ie. following a Stop with a Start. */
