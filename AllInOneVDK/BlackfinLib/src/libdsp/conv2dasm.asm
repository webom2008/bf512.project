  Module Name   : Convolution
  Label name   	:  __conv2d_fr16
  Description   : This file contains two dimensional convolution  of two given
                  matrices. The whole implementation is in Assembly language 
                  for Blackfin Processor. In this implementation convolution of
                  two matrices `a` and `b` is calculted. The dimension of 'a'
                  is na x ma and that of 'b' is nb x mb. The dimension of the
                  output matrix c will nc x mc, where -
                  nc = na + nb - 1.
                  mc = ma + mb - 1.
				  The equivalent C code is as follows:

				  for (i = 0; i < num_rowof_b; i++)
                  {
                     for (j = 0; j < num_colof_b; j++)
                     {
                       w = *(r++); //Starting address of B
         
                       p = c1 + j + i * num_colof_c; //P points to 32 bit buffer
                       q = a;               //Starting address of A

                       for (k = 0; k < num_rofof_a; k++)
                       {
                         for (l = 0; l < num_colof_a; l++)
                         {
					    	*p = *p + ((*q *w)>>15);
					    	p++, q++;
						
                         }
                         p += mb - 1;
                       }
                     }
                    }

                 There is no restriction on the size of both the arrays. The
				 whole implementation is for 16 bit fract input output. The
				 format of representation is 1Q15 format. 

  Registers Used : R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, A0, A1, P0, P1.
  Other Register Used : I0, I2, I3 set and LC0 and LC1.

  All the buffers A, B, C and temp are pointing to different memory bank.

  Performance:
               The Code size = 188 bytes.
			   The cycle count for A = 3 x 4 and B = 2 x 5    =  1073 cycles. 
			   The cycle count for A = 4 x 11 and B = 3 x 15  = 11895 cycles

/*
* The stack is used for temporary storage of intermediate results.
* It is done to minimize the bit error. The following example illustrates its
* importance.
*
*      Let x_16 = 0x5000;           Let y_16 = 0x6000;          Let z_16 = 0xC000;
*      Let temp_16 and temp_32 are two intermediate storage.
*
*      The operation temp_16 = x_16 + y_16  = 0x5000 + 0x6000 = 0xb000 = 0x7fff.
*      The operation temp_16 = temp_16 + z_16 = 0x7fff + 0xc000 = 0x3fff. ........(1)
*
*      The operation temp_32 = x+16 + y_16 = 0x5000 + 0x6000 = 0xb000.
*      The operation temp_32 = temp_32 + z_16 = 0xb000 + 0xffffc000 = 0x7000. .....(2)
*
* Now, from (1) and (2) the bit error introduced in the first operation is understood.
