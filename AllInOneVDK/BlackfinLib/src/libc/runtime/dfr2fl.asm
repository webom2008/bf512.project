* Function:  FR32_TO_FLOAT -- Convert a fract32 to a floating-point value
*
* Synopsis:
*
*       #include <fract2float_conv.h>
*       float fr32_to_float(fract32 x);
*
* Description:
*
*       The fr32_to_float converts a fixed-point, 32-bit fractional number
*       in 1.31 notation into a single precision, 32-bit IEEE floating-point
*       value. No rounding is performed and so, for example, 0x7fffffff is
*       converted to 0.99999994e0 and not to 1.0e0.
*
* Algorithm:
*
*       The traditional algorithm to convert a 1.31 fractional numbers to
*       floating-point value is:
*
*           r = (float)(x) / 2147483648.0
*           r = copysignf(minf(fabs(r),0.99999994e0),r)
*
*       However on Blackfin, floating-point division is relatively slow,
*       and one can alternatively adapt the algorithm for converting from
*       an int to a float and then subtracting 31 from the exponent to
*       simulate a division by 2147483648.0.
*
*       The following is a slower C implementation of this function:

            #include <fract2float_conv.h>

            extern float
            fr32_to_float(fract32 x)
            {

                float result;
                int *presult = (int *)(&result);

                if (x == 0x80000000)
                   return -1.0;

                result = fabsf(x);
                if (result != 0.0) {
                    *presult = *ptemp - 0x0f800000;
                    if (x < 0)
                       result = -result;
                }

                return result;

            }
*
*       WARNING: This algorithm assumes that the floating-point number
*       representation is conformant with IEEE.
*
* Cycle Counts:
*
*       26 cycles when the input is 0 or 0x80000000
*       26 cycles for all other input
*
*       These cycle counts were measured using the BF532 cycle accurate
*       simulator and include the overheads involved in calling the function
*       as well as the costs associated with argument passing.
*
* Code Size:
*
*       52 bytes
*
* Registers Used:
*
*       R0 - the input argument and result
*       R1 - various
*       R2 - various
*
* Clobbered registers:

/* The following algorithm contains four tricks:
**
** Trick [1]:
**     This is not a trick but it is worth pointing out that no rounding
**     is required (otherwise 0x7fffffff will be converted to 1.0 which
**     is outside the domain of fractional numbers expressed in 1.31
**     notation).
**
** Trick [2]:
**     After normalizing X, use its MSB as the LSB of the exponent - this
**     means that we do not have to arrange for this bit (which represents the
**     hidden bit of an IEEE floating-point number) to be discarded. What we
**     do is shift the bit into the LSB of the exponent field and then *add*
**     the (suitably-adjusted) value of the exponent into this field.
**
** Trick [3]:
**     Implement a floating-point divide by 2147483648.0 by subtracting 31
**     from the exponent of the dividend (because 2^31 == 2147483648.0); this
**     trick is utilized while calculating the required value of the exponent.
**
** Trick [4]:
**     This is a short-cut to adding the sign bit to the final result - a
**     typical way of doing this would be to set the MSB of the result but
**     only if the original argument was negative - this particular trick
**     uses two instructions by utilizing the ROT(ate) instruction. We start
**     by making sure that CC is set if the input argument is -ve; we then
**     perform a 1-bit rotate to the right, which rotates the source register
**     by copying the CC register to the MSB of the result and copying the
**     LSB of the source register into the CC register. So for this trick
**     to work, we shall have to set up the exponent field in bits 31-24
**     (rather than bits 30-23), and the mantissa in bits 23-1.

** So the algorithm works as follows:
**
** Step [1]:
**     Normalizes (shifts) X so that the MSB is at bit 24 (ie 0x01000000)
**
** Step [2]:
**     Calculates the value of the exponent minus 1 and shifts it 24 bits
**     to the left (so that it occupies the most significant byte)
**
** Step [3]:
**     Adds Step [1] and Step [2]
**
** Step [4]:
**     Sets CC if X is negative
**
** Step [5]:
**     Rotates Step [3] one place to the right
